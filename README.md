# WalkTheSquare
Step into a world of exclusive promotions as you stroll through the city, where geolocation meets excitement, delivering irresistible offers straight to your phone!

## Disclaimer
As of June 5th, 2023. I have an uncompleted project but still would like feedback from judges. 

## Inspiration
I'm a restaurant-goer in my free time and enjoy the food over there. Most of the time, I usually walk over there or use a rideshare app. It got me thinking, "What if there's a way to reward users if they randomly stop by to a restaurant as a first-timer?"  And that's how Walk the Square was born. 

## What it does
What it intends to do is the app uses geofencing, and if a user walks into the geofence, it gets a push notification of a promotion from a square-powered business.  Businesses make their own promotional details by using Square's authentication to access the merchant's details, their location, and the radius of the geofence. Then that information is stored in a Google Map. If users can share the promotion, then users will get loyalty points to redeem by using Square's Loyalty API.

## How I built it
With the technologies below, I have designed the mock-ups and the general flow of the app. 

Typescript, React-Native, Firebase, Expo, Google Maps, Square API's

## Challenges I ran into
Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to finish it on time. From finals to scratching the idea of the project. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I made a youtube channel to track my progress. 

Made the basis of the application and flow from businesses and users. 

## What I learned
What helped me the most is the consult with the Square Developers about their technologies and how it was implemented. Other than that it was learning more about Square's technologies. 

## What's next for Walk The Square
No plans at the moment. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!
